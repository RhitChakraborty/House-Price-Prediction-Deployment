# House-Price-Prediction-Deployment

## Predicting Sale Price of Houses

The aim of the project is to build a machine learning model to predict the sale price of homes based on different explanatory variables describing aspects of residential houses. 

### Why is this important? 

Predicting house prices is useful to identify fruitful investments, or to determine whether the price advertised for a house is over or under-estimated.

### What is the objective of the machine learning model?

We aim to minimise the difference between the real price and the price estimated by our model. We will evaluate model performance using the mean squared error (mse) and the root squared of the mean squared error (rmse).
